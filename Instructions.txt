Assignment 1:

Create an html page and display all the data in an li fetched from this url
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
publish only the title attribute of json object in li
Comments:The approach used is very good and clean but ek html ki ul ko update krne ke liye bar bar function call 
krna is not good so instead of calling a function make a gloabal object and store the recieved json and and create a loop 
of ul.createchild and append the data.
the reason is browser works as a stack so if one function is executing others will have to wait so bahut calls lag jayengi to page ka baki function wait
me reh jaayenge 

Assignment 2:
